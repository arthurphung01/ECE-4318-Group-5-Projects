In part a, we were tasked to compute 3 cases: 50!, 100!, and 2^63 - 1.
In part b, we were tasked to create addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, greater than, and length of digit functions.
Below is a screenshot of the terminal computing all of these cases, where the first 3 cases are part a and the later cases are part b.
